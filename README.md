# Modular-Phone-Case
This phone case is designed for iPhone which can help users to extend their phonesâ€˜ functionalities

In this Repo, there will severial folders which contains infomation of each part of the phone case which 
includes code, electronic components set up, 3D model and logic flow diagrams. I named the phonecase as
BlockCase

Block case follows I2C protocol, the case itself is called "base" which is the master or core component of
the device. Any other modulars are called "module" which are the slave of "base".
